# osu!arcade

The **osu!arcade** was a prototype arcade machine running [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream), a touch-based version of osu!(stable).

It was originally developed in 2010 and contained custom-made hardware as well as a built-in touchscreen.

At the time, it received positive feedback from the community.

## Technical overview/features

- e.g. led lighting controlled by microcontroller
- uses osu!stream as the game basis

## Development/History

- v1 to v2 etc.
- work on v2 started around 2012 apparently (judging from images and videos)
- v1 still used normal osu! (stable) (see images showcasing the interface)
- eventually osu!arcade was not developed further (still a prototype) probably due to the shift to lazer development
- also creating an osu!arcade is very costly
