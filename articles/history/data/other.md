# osu! lore

Potentially suitable for the wiki: 

- [pp records (each player to break the next barrier)](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/1gjf8h0/first_player_to_break_each_pp_milestone_barrier/)
- [flyte's osu! account once had a join date of 01.01.1970](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/11hxjfh/flyte_osu_designer_has_a_join_date_of_1_january/): peppy added him directly via a database command instead of over the website (flyte used a mac and could not create an account in-game) which caused the account creation date to be set to 0. The UNIX timestamp is counted as a number for the seconds passed since 01.01.1970. peppy fixed this mistake after the user u/katzenmesser made him aware of this via a reddit post.
