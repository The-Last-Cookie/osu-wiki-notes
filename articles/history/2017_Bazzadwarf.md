# History of osu! 2017

Note 1: This is WIP, bullet points that have been **BOLDED** are events that **IN MY OPINION** are of note and should probably be mentioned in some form.

Note 2: I am not a mapper so my knowledge on mapping related things is small, input from other people would be nice.

Note 3: I wanted to include notable scores but there are so many scores to filter out over a year that I have no idea where to start without it feeling biased.

## January

### News/Updates

- **Allow for multiple scores to be submitted per map (implmented in CE in Jan, rolled out to stable in Feb)** [source](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/stable40/20170222.3)
