  - osu! as arcade machine plan in general? --> 2014 ([peppy once tweeted about it](https://nitter.net/ppy/status/1380378232713699330))

On the [Wai-con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wai-Con) anime convention in Perth, osu! had an osu!arcade booth which featured a fully self-contained arcade machine running a special version of osu! on it. Although playing too much on it could lead to sore fingers, the prototype containing custom-made hardware and a built-in touchscreen was well-received by the community.[^wai-con]

## February

A new osu! update made small improvements in the overall user interface and added the ability to move all storyboard events by an arbitrary time value, allowing for more fine-tuned storyboard animations. In addition to this, usernames became clickable in chat logs.[^stable-b1460]

Through February and March, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) organised an art competition about drawing banners for in-game challenges. After a [community voting](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/27112?n=1) concluded, the osu! team picked the final selection. The winner's art being officially used as well as one year of [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) or physical goods being awarded were in prospect for the competition's finalist.[^art-challenge]

On March 8, an osu! update brought mainly performance and audio improvements to the game.[^stable-b1485]

[nardii](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1017) gave peppy access to their [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account [@osugame](https://twitter.com/osugame) which was used for general osu! news from then on.[^twitter-osugame]
