## January

On the second week of January, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) was interviewed by [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), the team responsible for developing [Realm](https://realm.io/), a database system used in osu!(lazer). In the interview, they talked about topics such as the origin of osu!, how osu! is making revenue, osu!'s development and infrastructure, as well as the transition to osu!(lazer).[^interview-mongodb]

Due to an update to osu!(lazer) on 21 January, mappers became able to set the preview time of a beatmap in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor). Furthermore, the gameplay progress bar was redesigned for the "argon" skin and the ability to change the screen's coverage of the [Fade In](/wiki/Gameplay/Game_modifier/Fade_In) mod was added. Lastly, [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) were enabled for scores which caused a spike in player activity. Right after the update went live, the scores set per day increased from 103,000 the day earlier to 302,000 and the concurrent player count rose from around 200 to 1,600.[^lazer-jan-21]

Thanks to [ThePoon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/718454) and other contributors, [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) was ported to [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), a game specifically designed for handheld devices and with unique gameplay elements. Until then, it was only available on [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS). An implementation on Android was not planned at the time when the development of the iOS version began in 2011 due to audio-related restrictions in Android's infrastructure that would heavily affect the gameplay experience.[^osu-stream-twitter][^osu-stream-pr]

The download page on the osu! website received a redesign, with an additional download option for osu!(lazer). Prior to this change, only osu!(stable) was downloadable via the website and users needed to download osu!(lazer) directly from the [GitHub repository `ppy/osu`](https://github.com/ppy/osu). At the time, the osu!(lazer) download was on the right side of the page. The eventual goal was to swap the two download dialogues, so the osu!(lazer) download would become more noticeable.[^lazer-download]

## February

Featuring a panel of various people from the community, an [osu! community meeting](/wiki/Community/osu!_community_meetings) was held to debate revisions in gameplay mechanics like mod multipliers adapting to speed changes, and the score integration between stable and lazer scores.<!--describe more thoroughly?--> This was done in combination of discussing remaining issues of osu!(lazer)'s user acceptance.[^meeting-02-12]

The markdown language [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode) which is used in the osu! forums and on parts of the website acquired the new `[c]` tag, enabling to highlight inline text.[^c-tag]

Among other additions, multi touch input for mobile devices was added for the osu! game mode in osu!(lazer) and the Accuracy Challenge mod was implemented, requiring players to stay above a certain accuracy threshold throughout a beatmap.[^lazer-feb-07]

The top three entries from 3rd to 1st place, respectively by [BatuhanYtho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12091015), [moonstaar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27339355), and [- Koshiin -](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19135423), received custom badges as the contest's price. Each finalist ranging from place #1 to #10 was gifted different amounts of osu!supporter.[^soty-results]

[EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2927048) received the osu!completionist title and is thus the third who played all ranked beatmaps in the [osu! game mode](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) as of March 12 2023.[^completionist-tweet]

![](img/medals-may.png "Medals published in May")

## June

On June 6, ScoreV2 was implemented (#23638).<!--what is scorev2 (short description)--> accuracy challenge mod received "maximum achievable" mode (#23317), sample bank selection added in editor (#20829), pause screen revamp (#23646, #23647)

In the second release of the month 2 weeks later, the osu! [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) in osu!(lazer) received the Synesthesia mod which colours [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_objects) based on timing.[^synesthesia-mod] Furthermore, a search panel was added to the mod select screen to simplify finding certain mods.[^mod-search] The input field could be activated by pressing `Tab` to not collide with normal keyboard shortcuts.

The third season of [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly) ended with the [9th edition](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-06-26-osumonthly-9), outlining the most important community events from March 2023. Mainly due to the mapping team within the project disbanding[^mapping-team-disbanding] and the ample effort required to author osu!monthly editions, the osu!monthly team decided to put the project on hold for the time being. Reorganising the work and publishing seasonal or annual editions instead was considered in various discussions.[^monthly-discord][^writing-proposal] [0x84f](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724), one of the third season's project leader, also published public polls to find out what the community was interested in and would like to see in the osu! website's news section in general.[^news-content-1][^news-content-2] Serving as a memorial to the first two seasons that were published as PDF, the 9th osu!monthly was realised [as a magazine](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://assets.ppy.sh/media/osu-monthly/2023-03/osu-monthly-2023-03.pdf) instead of the usual news posts, containing a cover artwork, mapping and skinning news, as well as a crossword quiz. The quickest user to correctly fill out the crossword quiz would receive [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter). To accentuate the last edition as a special one, it was accompanied by interviews with EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418).

Every player's country of residence is shown via a flag on their profile. Due to the flag assignment being automatic on account creation, some players were given a wrong flag. To change this, they were able to contact the [Account Support Team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) by providing a proof of their residence. Due to sensible information being transmitted in this process and frequent abuse cases occurring, this option was discontinued between December 2021 and July 2023. With a new system in place, players became able again to change their flag under certain conditions on the [account settings page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit). The system logs from which country osu! was accessed for 6 months. If 4 out of 6 months of this data present the same country, and the player is not registered for any ongoing tournaments, they are able to adjust their flag.[^flag-pr][^flag-issue][^flag-news]
