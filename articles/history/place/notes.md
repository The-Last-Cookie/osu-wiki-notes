# Notes

I could imagine one or several news posts describing the evolution of the pixel war might be the most suitable for the required freedom in writing and inclusion of topics. Even for a history article in the wiki, this concept is potentially too broad. Something along the lines of just a circle in 2017 to several images in 2022 to a bad apple animation in 2023.

With additional information on:

- the coordination between the builders on discord
- the influence of streamers like btmc
- community efforts like pixel placement helper tools, heatmaps and the 3d animation of the pixel placement
- other trivia knowledge like the 5-monitor setup or peppy being called pewdiepie presented in an amusing way
