# osu! r/place 2022

Place a pixel from a palette with 16 colours every 5 minutes on a 2000 x 2000 canvas. At first, the canvas was 1000 x 1000, then 2000 x 1000 (second day) before it grew to its final size (third day). The event happened from 1 April to 4 April.

## map

things to find on the final map:

- image of peppy and a little slider to his left side
- osu! logo (with triangles and game modes)
- osu! logo and r/osuplace at the bottom left
- hit circle with a 1
- osu! storyboarder banquet (osb)
- taiko no tatsujin logo
- wysi image (when you see it)
- 727 as text

  - artwork centered at 727,727
  - management plans like a spreadsheet listing the positioning of each individual pixel, which would eventually turned into the use of an overlay extension that would display small dots on top of the tiles showing users what specific color tile to place
  - a design change occurred after the canvas expansion adding gamemode icons and triangles to the logo

| 02:17 | The event was announced one week prior. A small team began planing the construction of the logo on a discord server (/u/emanfman seemed to be the manager). |
| 02:52 | A template was made to make it more clear where each colour should be placed. |
| 03:00 | Centre of the logo is at 727,727 |
| 03:20 | BTMC helped in construction. Logo was done after half an hour, and thus one of the first recognisable artworks. |
| 03:40 | Coordinated callouts to help in construction |
| 04:12 | Many people wanted the osu! logo gone and posted memes about it (e.g. convert osu! logo into kirby) |
| 04:35 | Mizkif told his community to draw over the osu! logo with black pixels. |
| 05:30 | osu! community attacked the frog of mizkif, some back and forth between them |
| 06:00 | they agreed upon a peace treaty |
| 06:10 | Chrome extension script to see where which colour needs to be placed |
| 06:30 | Lots of attacks on the logo, though also lots of alliances |
| 06:38 | On April 2, the canvas doubled in size to the right |
| 06:50 | Triangles were added to the logo template (more depth in general) |
| 07:30 | Planning of the image of peppy |
| 09:30 | War with xQc. he would eventually attack other communities and osu! could recover |
| 10:00 | Day 3: canvas doubled again to the bottom |
| 10:20 | New images: wysi and a hit circle, and a "taskbar tab" |
| 11:56 | French streamer attacked osu! logo on "whiteout", which lead people to believe the osu! community was botting |

Comment by Kris-od3sj on the xQc canvas invasion:

- Mizkiff was scared of osu, because of how poorly he ended up after messing with osu; he tells xQc to not mess with osu
- xQc attacks Turks
- he starts building tentacles to ruin the canvas
- attacks Hololive, which was defended by osu, despite not being an official ally at that point in time yet
- goes past osu cookie, unaware that he stomped pxls space, osu's ally
- decides to settle with a Twitch logo on pxls space land
- osu helps them get their land back
- xQc in response attacks osu
- he gets confused, and thinks it was actually Turkey attacking him, leaves osu and attacks turkey
- osu recovers
- xQc decides to build his logo over peppy, unaware it's osu's land
- osu tries to defend peppy
- xQc at some point finds out osu defended Hololive as well
- BTMC vs xQc negotiations happen
- xQc, because of wherever he goes osu defends it, assumes osu either claims a huge part of the canvas or is allied with it
- negotiations fail, xQc attacks osu cookie
- some more negotiations happen, in the meantime osu rebuilds the cookie, also puts a clown nose on xQc's logo
- xQc ends up leaving osu alone under the condition osu doesn't attack him and stops with the clown nose, also moves his logo to the blue corner
- peppy is rebuilt
From this point I didn't participate, so less details here:
- some more purple tentacles happened
- xQc covered Star Wars (another osu ally) with his logo, someone gives it a clown nose, he writes xQcL over the osu cookie
- Star Wars and osu cookie recover

any note-worthy posts in r/osugame and r/osuplace?

mention coordination of the drawing over discord server and r/osuplace?

### general r/place drama

Not sure if any osu! artworks were affected by this, but for the sake of completeness:

- reddit mods accused of cheating, they apparently had no 5 minutes countdown
- reddit mods also censored any kind of profanity and nudity by overdrawing with big rectangles

## idea for a dedicated article

Example structure for a separate article:

```md
## Artworks

Things to find on the final canvas and their history (management plan by BTMC and r/osuplace; griefing by xQc etc.)

## Community efforts

Stuff like the 3d animation

## Trivia

peppy is called pewdiepie on Place Atlas
