# osu! r/place 2022

Place a pixel from a palette with 16 colours every 5 minutes on a 2000 x 2000 canvas. At first, the canvas was 1000 x 1000, then 2000 x 1000 (second day) before it grew to its final size (third day). The event happened from 1 April to 4 April.

## map

things to find on the final map:

- image of peppy and a little slider to his left side
- osu! logo (with triangles and game modes)
- osu! logo and r/osuplace at the bottom left
- hit circle with a 1
- osu! storyboarder banquet (osb)
- taiko no tatsujin logo
- wysi image (when you see it)
- 727 as text

  - artwork centered at 727,727
  - management plans like a spreadsheet listing the positioning of each individual pixel, which would eventually turned into the use of an overlay extension that would display small dots on top of the tiles showing users what specific color tile to place
  - a design change occurred after the canvas expansion adding gamemode icons and triangles to the logo

| 03:00 | Centre of the logo is at 727,727 |
| 03:20 | BTMC helped in construction. Logo was done after half an hour, and thus one of the first recognisable artworks. |
| 03:40 | Coordinated callouts to help in construction |
| 04:12 | Many people wanted the osu! logo gone and posted memes about it (e.g. convert osu! logo into kirby) |

### general r/place drama

Not sure if any osu! artworks were affected by this, but for the sake of completeness:

- reddit mods accused of cheating, they apparently had no 5 minutes countdown
- reddit mods also censored any kind of profanity and nudity by overdrawing with big rectangles

## idea for a dedicated article

Example structure for a separate article:

```md
## Artworks

Things to find on the final canvas and their history (management plan by BTMC and r/osuplace; griefing by xQc etc.)

## Efforts by community members

Stuff like the 3d animation

## Trivia

peppy is called pewdiepie on Place Atlas
```
