# History articles

Collecting resources and writing history articles takes an immense amount of time. To make the documentation more feasible and making contributions easier, this directory is meant for taking notes throughout the year(s) while events are happening.

Regardless if the notes are in bullet points or already formulated phrases, the goal is to simplify the process of creating a finished history article that is added to the osu! wiki.

## Resources

As the osu! wiki may only include official stuff directly supported by osu!, it is recommended to collect information from the following resources:

- news posts
- issues/pull requests on github
- changelogs
- forum threads by peppy, smoogipoo, and ephmeral
- (only) official osu! events

The older history articles can of course be taken as an example for the basic structure and contents of history articles.

These resources might include stuff not worth mentioning but may still be a good starting point nonetheless:

- osu! recap videos
- history of osu!

## Editorial rules

*For the full set of rules for wiki articles, see: [Article styling criteria](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Article_styling_criteria)*

Keep in mind to put history articles in the past tense.

Additionally, the descriptions should be succinct and only contain essential descriptions of circumstances. Too many embellishments like often seen in news posts are not allowed.
